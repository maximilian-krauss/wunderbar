wunderbar
=========

wunderbar is a fancy Client for [wunderlist](http://www.wunderlist.com) on Windows.

Looking for something compiled?<br />
There is only the Sourcecode available at the moment. If the Application is stable and works without hassles I'll release a compiled Version on my [Projectpage](http://coffeeinjection.com#projects).
